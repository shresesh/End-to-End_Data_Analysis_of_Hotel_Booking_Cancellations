# Hotel Booking Cancellations: End-to-End Data Analysis

## 🏨 Project Overview
High cancellation rates significantly impact revenue in the hospitality industry. This project utilizes Python to perform a deep dive into hotel reservation data, identifying the key drivers behind cancellations. By analyzing pricing, seasonality, and customer behavior, this project provides data-driven recommendations to help hotels optimize their revenue and reduce "no-show" rates.

## 📊 Key Findings & Insights
* **Price Sensitivity:** Identified a strong positive correlation between higher **Average Daily Rates (ADR)** and increased cancellation rates.
* **Seasonality Trends:** Discovered that cancellations peak during specific months, suggesting a need for dynamic seasonal overbooking strategies.
* **Lead Time Impact:** Analysis revealed that reservations made with longer lead times are significantly more likely to be cancelled.
* **Market Segment Analysis:** Evaluated how different booking channels (Online TA vs. Offline) contribute to the bottom line, highlighting varying risk levels.

## 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
  * **Pandas & NumPy:** For data cleaning, handling missing values, and complex data manipulation.
  * **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and creating high-impact statistical visualizations.
* **Techniques:** * **Data Cleaning:** Removing duplicates and handling outliers (e.g., zero-price entries).
  * **Correlation Analysis:** Using heatmaps to identify relationships between pricing and guest behavior.
  * **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncovering hidden patterns in reservation status across various market segments.

## 🖥️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Wrangling:** Loading the raw dataset and performing ETL tasks to ensure data integrity.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing the distribution of cancellations across different hotel types (City vs. Resort).
3. **Hypothesis Testing:** Validating the impact of pricing and deposit types on the likelihood of a cancellation.
4. **Actionable Recommendations:** Formulating strategies for non-refundable pricing tiers and targeted re-engagement campaigns.

## 📂 How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed (`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`).
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to view the full analysis and visualizations.
